        <p>The tamale recipe that I will be sharing with you today is one that my mom makes for us when
        she feels up to the task. These do take a while to prepare but in the end when
        you get to enjoy them with your family, all the hard work will be worth it. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Masa Flour</li>
            <li>Tomatillo</li>
            <li>Serano Pepper</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Chicken</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Lard</li>
            <li>Corn Husk</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Baking Powder</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the corn husks by soaking them in warm water while we begin doing the following steps, this
            ensures that the husks are easier to work with when we are ready to wrap the tamales.</li>
            <li>Put the chicken in a pot along with the water, onion, garlic and salt. Cook the chicken to at
            least 165 degrees.</li>
            <li>Boil the tomatillos and peppers until they are nice and cooked. Add them to a blender with
            some garlic and salt and blend them until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken to the salsa that was just prepared and set aside.</li>
            <li>Whip the Lard in a bowl until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add the masa flour and the baking powder to the Lard.</li>
            <li>Add some of the broth to the flour and begin mixing by hand until thoroughly incorporated. Add more
            broth if you feel the flour is too thick, if you added to much broth add a little more masa flour.</li>
            <li>Grab a corn husk and remove the hair, use a spoon to spread the masa onto the corn husk, use another
            spoon to add the chicken and salsa mixture. Wrap the tamale and place it in a steaming pot and repeat
            until the masa or the salsa runs out.</li>
            <li>Steam the tamales for two hours, remove one tamale and let it rest until firm. If the tamale
            does not get firm after cooling off continue to cook the tamales and repeat the process every
            20 mins until the tamale gets firm. After confirming that the tamales are done cooking
            you may now proceed to enjoy the little pieces of heaven.</li>
